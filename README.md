# 100DaysOfPython

I have always been concerned if I am confident in a particular programming language. In order to combat this fear of mine, I have decided to dive deep into my 
fears and embark on a journey of coding everyday in Python for the next 100 days.

I have been training under **Undemy's 100 Days Of Python** and shall be sharing all the projects I would be working on.
